## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

When contributing to this project:

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Tokens
   - Private keys
   - Environment variables with sensitive data

2. **Use environment variables**:
   - Store configuration in `.env` files
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use `.env.example` for templates

3. **Validate user input**:
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Use proper validation for forms
   - Escape output to prevent XSS

4. **Keep dependencies updated**:
   - Regularly update npm packages
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities

5. **Follow secure coding practices**:
   - Use HTTPS for API calls
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Implement rate limiting on client side

### For Users

1. **Keep your software updated**:
   - Use the latest version of the application
   - Keep your browser updated
   - Update Node.js and npm regularly

2. **Use strong passwords**:
   - Use unique, complex passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication (when available)

3. **Be cautious**:
   - Don't share your credentials
   - Log out after using shared computers
   - Report suspicious activity

## üîê Security Features

This application implements the following security measures:

### Frontend Security

- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for all user inputs
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection through JSX escaping
- **HTTPS**: Enforced HTTPS connections in production
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure Storage**: Local storage encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **CORS**: Proper CORS configuration for API requests

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security audits with `npm audit`
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] No sensitive data in code or commits
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] No new `npm audit` vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Environment variables used for configuration
- [ ] Proper error handling (no sensitive info in error messages)
- [ ] HTTPS used for all external API calls
- [ ] Authentication state properly managed
- [ ] No console.log statements with sensitive data

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Local Storage

We use local storage for:

- User preferences (theme, language)
- Authentication tokens (encrypted)
- Chat history (non-sensitive data)

**Note**: Local storage is accessible via JavaScript. Never store highly sensitive data in local storage.

### Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update:

- React and React DOM
- Material-UI components
- Axios (HTTP client)
- Other npm packages

### API Communication

- All API calls use HTTPS in production
- Authentication tokens are included in request headers
- Timeout configured to prevent hanging requests
- Proper error handling for failed requests
